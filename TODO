  * on the www side - nicely show and index themes with previews in html
* clean up e profiles, elm profiles and per screen profiles
  * move to a new profile method which has a fallback profile
    * also has to include scaling options like manual or based on dpi
  * then per screen profiles + scaling too  but do this all via the per
    screen profile infra - always go that path
* illume: work on this again given pinephone + librem5 appeared
  * single app at a time with switching mode
    * winlist should do the switching with another layout mode...
  * shelf can expamnd/slow down to show more (indicator/notification)
    * gadget bar too... ? or just gad bar?
  * shelf autohide. Move this to edje.
  * vkbd integrates with proper sizing and layout
    * manual show/hide with various controls (actions, swipes, gadget)

  auto-extension, backlight and other such controls.
* console logger much like quake console like dropdown for logging etc
  (api to append logs. always stores to disk to specific file.
   add button to explicitly share like screenshots. add higher level

* efm: use elm scroller for fm view
* efm: use elm for file popup
* efm: add disk space used bar for disk volume icons
* efm: add space used "du -sh" summary for all folders
* efm: add filesystem cache (all dirs cached in files and updated in bg)
  * should be a full filesystem shadow stored to cache db files
  * async update/scan of dir and present updates when done and have changes
  * store file, stat info, other metadata, mimetype, icon, space used...
* efm: thumbs for music getting album art like rage
* efm: thumbs for videos with movie posters like rage
* efm: show symlink info in icon
* efm: fuse support (mtp, sshfs, cifs/smb etc.)
* efm: rsync integration for fsync to/from targets
  * may need ssh setup too (add to authorized keys on other end)
* efm: partitioning front end
* efm: filesystem formatting front-end
* efm: tune2fs/fsck front-end
* start: start menu could do with more featured content
  * like you see on windows for example (search and multiple columns etc.)
  * a touch screen android-style scrolling fullscreen app icon style
* music-control: allow manual addition of new named mpris services
* connman:
  * divide the popup list with group headers like bz5 into tech
  * provide fuller status per line (reception and other info?)
  * massively flesh out connman vpn support in the gui
    * vpnmanager + create method support
  * one day look at network manager support
  * look into iwd too
* bz5: add icon set for actions/states per bt device (pair.unpair, etc.)
* bz5: add obex agent support integrated with efm for sharing via bt
  and downloads when received via obex bt (~/Downloads/...)
* battery: redesign popup to list other battery details like the
  charge if you have multiple batteries for real or separately the
  battery levels of e.g. bt mice, kbd's and other such devices
* battery: on click display popup like wireless/bluez5
  in popup show detailed list of battery devices and data per device
  * like bluez5 use genlist with groups for core batteris vs other misc devices
  * filter out hid devices with batteries from core battery state
  * display other devices in above list separately
  * handle string capacity values like Full, High, Normal, Low, Critical...
* randr: get auto layout to handle screens laid out like:
  [dp2-2][dp2-1] <- 2 external monitors
      [edp-1] <- laptop main display
* randr: when losing a zone/screen, put windows in purgatory and then have
  purgatory screens available via pager to drag onto a current screen,
  or the specific virtual desktops from purgator to be accessible even
  if not on a real screen/zone
* device manager: new tool to browser /sys etc. and display nicely present
  hardware and device drivers and state
* sys top: new tool displays cpu/mem "top" - evisum. we want it to be shipped
  with e though so it's always there guaranteed have back-end system status
  logging to files all day long that always starts with e. gui is a front-end
  view to this back-end data log and follows it as it updates.
  * can go back in time then to previous logs
  * should have the ability to draw nice graphs etc.
* ddc: provide ddc controls for all the other properties than backlight
  (contrast, sharpness, r, g, b, correction, color temp, osd on/off etc.)
* ddc: provide abstract interface to query rotation of monitors...
* edge bindings - selecting edge dialog needs a redo (no edje for all content)
* e menu - add obj cache for menu and menu item objects to reduce costs
  by far the biggest cost in showing/hiding menus is realize/unrealize
  and this is almost all object creation/setup/deletion costs. menus
  can be more responsive (on low end systems) if... we avoid this. to
  avoid... have a cache of spare objecta to re-use.
* e comp object: we dirty far too often in wayland especially with
  glmark and this leads to a stream of gen and del textures. is this
  really needed and ca we cut it down?
* tiling: doesnt retain layout across restarts
* tiling: doesnt handle impossible layouts well - had to remove min size
* tiling: doesnt honor size stepping too well
* tiling: probably need to flatten out to table for saner layout
* tiling: probably could do with analysis on features vs i3 etc. to be
  more "up to snuff" and competitive
* tiling could be smoother in its layout handling
  * smoothly move/resize windows from old to new positions/sizes
  * don't delay many responses and do it instantly with the above anim
  * probably can do with more actions for bindings for moving/sizing
* packagekit: much btter support with pre-made config/profiles for the
  package manager (autodetect if possible)
  * not just updates but also install/uninstall of pkgs with a minimal
    front-end to back-end cmdline tools (use shell wrappers?)
* cpufreq: support pstate: hwp_dynamic_boost, no_turbo, display turbo_pct,
  num_pstates
* advanced per-device config (xinput device by device). current is simple
  generic "global" config e.g. for the mouse
* look into libratbag too for gaming mouse stuff if its worth using it or
  just doing the same
  stuff ourselves as we will probably have to via libinput
* some kind of game mode and detection that will do things like:
  * disable screen dimming/blanking
  * set cpu to max performance
  * lower priority/nice of non-game processes or even sigstop procs
  * disable notifications
  * explicit toggle and possible auto-detect of games running
* per app environment launch config - allow different TZ, LOCALE etc.
  per app and set up env appropriately
* back-end e system process for monitoring/polling and launching etc.
  * split e up into front vs back-end with back-end doing things like
    * monitoring processes/system (see above)
    * launching apps (cheaper to fork a small process)
* synergy-like e <-> e mouse, kbd, cnp, dnd proxy/sharing
* cpufreq - move to config dialog for settings
  * set governor for ac vs battery (or powerstate levels)
  * set pstate min and max for ac vs battery (or power state levels)
* set backlight and dim timeout per powersave level
* battery - set powersave levels based on ac or battery level
* efl: flat theme redo
* efl/eo: start using efl loop as core loop
  * begin to move some login out into efl threads+loops
    * to change ui - callsync/async back to ui/main loop
  * have a deferred deletion of evas objects in idler
    * hide instead of del, stash in invisible place, delete l8r in idler
  * have object stash for adding basic objects
    * have generic/basic object stash
    * have edje object stash
