Please report bugs and submit patches at https://phab.enlightenment.org

Requirements
------------

Must:
  * efl
  * xcb
  * xcb-shape
  * xcb-keysyms
  * libpam (On Linux)

Highly suggested:
  * evas_generic_loaders (All loaders)
  * bluez5 (BT support and l2ping tool)
  * connman
  * bc (For everything calculator)
  * pulseaudio
  * acpid (Unless your system doesn't have ACPI at all)
  * packagekit (For packagekit module updates status)
  * udisks2
  * gdb (If you want automatic bactraces in ~/.e-crashdump.txt)

NOTE: Users of DR16 will need to rename the $prefix/bin/enlightenment
file prior to installing this release or it will be overwritten.

Please see the INSTALL file for now to compile and install it.

NOTE: If you do not want security issues make sure sysactions.conf is in
/etc/enlightenment (not PREFIX/etc/enlightenment) as this is the first place
it looks at. This file is intended to be customized by packagers and
system integrators to match your policies and scripts/tools.

NOTE: To enable wayland support (still considered experimental and not for
regular end users) use the meson -Dwayland=true option. To run
enlightenment in wayland mode, just log on on ant vt and run
enlightenment_start. If you wish to debug and see all the output try
using something like screen then attaching to the remote screen
session by sshing in etc.
